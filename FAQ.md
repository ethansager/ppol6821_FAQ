## Training Issues

### Overfitting

**Q: My model performs well on training data but poorly on validation/test data. What's wrong?**


### Underfitting

**Q: My model performs poorly on both training and validation data. What should I do?**

### Vanishing Gradients

**Q: My deep network trains very slowly or stops improving after a few epochs. What's happening?**

### Exploding Gradients

**Q: My loss becomes NaN or extremely large during training. What's the issue?**

A: You're experiencing exploding gradients, where gradients become too large during backpropagation.

### Slow Training

**Q: My model takes too long to train. How can I speed it up?**

### Loss Not Decreasing

**Q: My loss isn't decreasing at all. What could be wrong?**

## Implementation Issues

### Data Loading

**Q: What are common mistakes in data loading and preprocessing?**

### Model Architecture

**Q: How do I choose the right model architecture?**

### Hyperparameter Tuning

**Q: How should I tune hyperparameters?**

### Reproducibility

**Q: My results vary between runs. How can I ensure reproducibility?**

A: Random seeds and environment factors affect reproducibility.

**Solution:**
```python
import random
import numpy as np
import torch

def set_seed(seed=42):
    random.seed(seed)
    np.random.seed(seed)
    torch.manual_seed(seed)
    torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(seed)
    torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True
    torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False

set_seed(42)
```

## Debugging Tips

### General Debugging Strategy

### Common Debugging Commands

```python
# Check model summary
print(model)

# Check tensor shapes
print(f"Input shape: {x.shape}")
print(f"Output shape: {y.shape}")

```
